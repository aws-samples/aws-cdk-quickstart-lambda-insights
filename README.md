# CDK TypeScript project for Lambda Insights.

## Why?

Use this cdk project to test AWS CloudWatch Lambda Insights.

## Setup Stack

```
$ git clone https://git-codecommit.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/aws-cdk-quickstart-lambda-insights  (this will be changed to aws-samples public link before being published out)
$ npm install 
$ cd resources && npm install 
$ cdk bootstrap   
$ cdk synth       
$ cdk deploy      
```

The cdk will deploy below architecture.

Go to the Cloudformation console and search for ServiceTestStack and check Outputs. Take a note of the 4 API end points.  To generate data for lambda insights, we will use CloudWatch synthetics to make call to each API endpoint every minute.

Setup CloudWatch Synthetics Canaries to call the API end points every minute. The instructions to create a Canary are mentioned at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Create.html.
Once the 4 canaries are setup for each API End point, they should look like below-

We can go ahead and start looking at lambda insights in CloudWatch. To do this, go to CloudWatch and click on Multi-Function under Lambda Insights. Here, we can observe metrics for the four lambda functions which were created by the cdk.
